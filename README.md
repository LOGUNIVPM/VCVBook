The ABC plugin contains all modules described in the book. 

The book provides a quick and dirt introduction to developing virtual modular synthesizers using VCV Rack, a C++ open source platform developed since 2017. It will also serve as a music DSP primer for those who have not taken such classes in their under/postgrad studies. The book will come with an online source code repository. This page will host resources for readers.

# NOTE: The plugins are ready for RACK v2!

You will find all the instructions in the book.
For building ABC, clone this repository and copy the ABC folder in your Rack installation "plugins" folder, i.e.:
```
git clone https://github.com/LOGUNIVPM/VCVBook.git
cp -r VCVBook/ABC <myRackInstallationFolder>/plugins/
cd <myRackInstallationFolder>/plugins/ABC/
```
Now you are ready to build and tweak.

Please note: these examples are for didactical purposes only. They are not necessarily meant to be ideal, whatever this means. The book often provides a discussion on alternative ways to implement things, with pros and cons. Do not learn by Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V! 

# More info

In this video I'm showing some of the features of the book and help potential readers to understand if it fits their needs. I will discuss math and C++ coding pre-requisites as well as goal and contents.
